# Bitacora Digital

This project is intended to solve a real problem in my workplace, currently the cleaning and/or working status of the machines is registered manually with pen and paper, there is no easy way to check which machines require cleaning, the usage history of the machines is difficult to track and it is hard to guarantee that every operator follows the documentation requirements.

This app allows the operators to log every use and cleaning process, easing the data input and avoiding documentation errors. Supervisors may check every machine in a single app, easily find out every machine status and which machines require cleaning. Regulatory entities, both internal and external to the company may have an easy way to audit every machine log.
